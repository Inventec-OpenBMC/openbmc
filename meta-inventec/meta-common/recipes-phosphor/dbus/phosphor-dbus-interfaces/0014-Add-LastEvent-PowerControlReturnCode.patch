Subject: [PATCH] Bug623 - [SW][Transformers][OpenBMC][IPMI] Implement get
 chassis status command

    Symptom/Reason :
        - Implement the IPMI get chassis status command

    Root Cause:
        - None

    Solution/Change:
        [intel-ipmi-oem]
            - support attribute
                -- Current Power State
                    --- Power is on
                    --- Power overload
                    --- power fault
                    --- power control fault

                -- Last Power event
                    --- Power down caused by Power overload
                    --- Power down caused by power fault
                    --- Power is on casued by ipmi command

                -- Misc chassis State
                    --- Colling/fan detected
                    --- Chassis identify state
                    --- Chassis identify supported
        [phosphor-dbus-interface]
            - register attributes
                -- LastPowerEvent
                -- PowerControlReturnCode

        [phosphor-ipmi-host]
            - record the power control return code by ipmi command chassis control

        [x86-power-control]
            - register the LastPowerEvent and powerControlReturnCode to dbus system

        [inventec-dcmi-power]
            - monitor the power fault and power overload and do
                chassis power off if power fault or power overload.

    Entry Test:
        - ipmitool chassis status
        - ipmitool raw 0x00 0x01
            -- to get current chassis status
